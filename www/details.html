                    Naxos is the biggest and most fertile island in the group, located right in the centre of it. It
                    offers a host of choices to visitors about activities they can try, as well as other entertainment
                    and relaxation options. The whitewashed Chora town is a must-see, as is the majestic Portara, the
                    giant marble gate of an unfinished temple dedicated to Apollo.

                    Naxos is the biggest and most fertile island in the group, located right in the centre of it. It
                    offers a host of choices to visitors about activities they can try, as well as other entertainment
                    and relaxation options. The <strong>whitewashed Chora town</strong> welcomes travellers at its
                    harbour. <strong>Portara,</strong> Naxos’ most popular landmark, lies on the neighbouring
                    <strong>Palatia Islet;</strong> it is the marble gate of an unfinished ancient Greek temple
                    dedicated to god Apollo.<br /><br />
                    Chora’s built landscape is marked by numerous fortified palaces, which date to the island’s Venetian
                    Period, as Naxos was the seat of the Duchy of the Aegean. Make sure you visit the
                    <strong>Bazaios Tower,</strong> off Sagri village, the <strong>Glezos-Crispi Tower</strong> in
                    Chora, the <strong>Belonia Tower</strong> in Galanado and the
                    <strong>Della Rocca-Barozzi Tower</strong> in Chora.<br /><br />
                    The diverse, uneven landscape and the size of the island have helped shape a variety of ecosystems.
                    Explore them by following the <strong>signposted paths</strong> (Chora-Melanes-Chalki;
                    Chalki-Danakos-Apeiranthos; Skado-Apollonas, etc). The route from Apeiranthos to Moutsouna beach
                    goes through the old emery mines, and its beauty is breathtaking: you’ll enjoy the views of the
                    changing nature as you head towards the sea. The mountaineering and mountain biking fans will be
                    happy to explore <strong>Mt. Zas</strong> (elev. 1004m, the highest mountain on the Cyclades) and
                    <strong>Mt Fanari</strong> (elev. 908 m). As you climb Mt Zas, don’t miss out on visiting
                    <strong>Zas Cave</strong> at 628m elevation; you will be impressed by its stalagmites. In ancient
                    times, this location was a place of worship for Zeus, the father of the Olympian gods. On the left
                    side of the cave’s entrance, you will see the tiny country chapel of Zoodochos Pigi (Our Lady).<br /><br />
                    Naxos is an island with a rich cultural activity. <strong>Traditional festivals </strong>
